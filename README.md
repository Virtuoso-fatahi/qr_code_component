## My process

I started the project by understanding the several sections in the design. I also developed a plan to segment the design and accord appropriate classes and id to each section where necessary. Then, I started the development phase. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The first thing I learnt was that practice make perfect. Knowledge can only be solidify through practicing the things you know.

### Continued development

In my future project, I would like to work on projects using the best practices in development.
